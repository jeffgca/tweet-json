# View Twitter JSON

This is a *really* simple SDK-vased add-on that lets you view the JSON for the current tweet. When you view a url such as this one:

[https://twitter.com/t/status/207957532864544768](https://twitter.com/t/status/207957532864544768)

...the add-on adds a 'View JSON' link next to the 'Favourite' link. When you click on the 'View JSON' link, a pre-formatted element will open displaying a pretty-printed representation of the current tweet's JSON equivalent.
